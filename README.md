# PyDinoAI
Training a CNN to play the chrome://dino game by itself.

![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aniruddha-Tapas/PyDinoAI/master/dino.gif)

Steps to implement: 
* Open chrome://dino in your browser. Then run `create_training_data.py`. Adjust the region of interest ((380,150,970,290)) according to your computer screen. This will save the dino game pixel data and the keys pressed for events in a file called `training_data.npy`.
